At Meta, there's a group called **Analog Research Lab**. They materialize the cultural maxims many associate with the company: *"Move fast and break things"*, *"Don't mistake motion for progress"*, *"Meta, Metamates, Me"* and more.

My favorite has always been **"Begin Anywhere"**.

The sheer breadth and depth of Meta's infrastructure, codebase, and business logic make it a significant investment to understand how something works end-to-end. Whether you take a depth-first or breadth-first strategy, you could spend indefinite time exploring.

Despite that complexity, the mindset of starting anywhere is essential.

## Engineering at Meta

- **Almost all the stack is homegrown**: languages/runtime, wire protocols, web frameworks, version control, builds, container orchestration etc. Only some (React, GraphQL, PyTorch) are open source.

- **Unlike companies of similar size**, Meta's *entire* codebase is open to engineers internally. An engineer working on React could read Erlang code in WhatsApp or firmware code in Reality Labs.

- **Meta historically encouraged bottom-up innovation** over central planning. Your mental model can become outdated in quarters, not years. That's how fast things change.

- **Growing in seniority requires increasing leverage**. Increasing leverage requires broadening and deepening your knowledge of the ecosystem around your team's work. *The most successful engineers bend reality to their will or convince the organization to bend reality toward their vision*.

## Applying "Begin Anywhere"

> **Be strategic about ROI.** Is this exploration educational interest, optimistic outreach, or likely to yield near-term results? Clarity here is crucial.

> **Build minimal viable prototypes.** Reading and talking are useful, but nothing makes things concrete like changing code and watching it operate.

> **Be a beginner publicly.** When a very senior engineer on my team was learning Rust, he live-streamed rebuilding a CLI tool. This brought attention from internal Rust experts eager to help.

> **Stack your learnings.** If you understand pieces A and C in a chain A→B→C→D→E, learning B becomes a worthwhile investment.

> **Embrace partial knowledge.** You won't get full context, but you can build enough mental maps to operate and establish your bases.

The lesson extends beyond Meta: in any complex system, you have to jump into codebases and problems where you lack context. You can figure it out through code, docs, and asking for help. But most importantly:

**Begin anywhere. Be comfortable with uncertainty.**

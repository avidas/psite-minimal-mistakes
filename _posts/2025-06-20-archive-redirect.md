## Announcing Archive Redirect: Your One-Click Pass to the Web's Past

Broken links blocking your research? Paywalls cutting you off mid-article? Curious about what a site looked like before that major redesign? The web's history shouldn't be locked away behind friction and frustration.

## Meet Archive Redirect

**[Install Archive Redirect from the Chrome Web Store →](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gebiocogkhdldmpidlakmmoonjhhcjhm?utm_source=item-share-cb)**

**Archive Redirect** is a Chrome extension that instantly transports you to the Internet Archive's most recent snapshot of any webpage. No URL copying, no tab juggling, no searching through archive interfaces—just pure, frictionless access to the web's memory.

### The problem solved

Every day, millions of links break. Content disappears behind paywalls. Websites change without warning. Until now, accessing archived versions meant:

- Copying URLs manually
- Opening the Internet Archive in a new tab
- Searching and hoping a snapshot exists
- Dealing with slow load times and interface friction

There had to be a better way.

### How Archive Redirect works

The magic happens in three clicks:

1. **Navigate** to any webpage
2. **Click** the Archive Redirect icon in your toolbar
3. **Instantly view** the latest archived version

That's it. One click between you and the internet's history.

### Built for the curious and the blocked

Whether you're a journalist tracking how a story developed, a researcher accessing disappeared content, or simply someone who refuses to let broken links slow them down, Archive Redirect transforms how you interact with the web's past.
